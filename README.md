Creating QR code for a local business menu using python.
The QR code menu is a digital menu that allows guests to scan and access the digital menu  displayed on their smartphone after scanning.

To fend off the COVID19 pandemic, restaurant owners chose to digitize to ensure the safety of their customers when they return to business. After the bars and restaurants were reopened after the lockdown, the changes in normal operations  also changed. 

Food regulations are in place and these companies continue to use practices that keep them socially distant from getting infected with the virus. 
One way to safely reopen a restaurant or bar is  to convert the menu to non-contact to reduce the spread of the virus caused by multiple manual changes to the menu  that can lead to cross-contamination.
Hence, this project is the menu of a local business menu card which people can scan through their mobile phones.
